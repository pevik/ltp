# PLEASE INSTEAD CREATING PULL REQUEST SEND PATCHES TO OUR MAILING LIST

Although we accept GitHub pull requests, the preferred way is sending patches to our [mailing list](http://lists.linux.it/listinfo/ltp).
You can see your patches in [our patchwork instance](https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/ltp/list/).

You need to use [`git format-patch`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-format-patch) and [`git send-email`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-send-email).
Here is our [guide how to send patch](https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp/wiki/C-Test-Case-Tutorial#7-submitting-the-test-for-review).

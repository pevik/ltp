LTP Library guidelines
======================

General Rules
-------------

When we extend library API, we need to apply the same general rules that we use
when writing tests, plus:

#. LTP library tests must go inside ``lib/newlib_tests`` directory
#. LTP documentation has to be updated according to API changes

Shell API
---------

API source code is in ``tst_test.sh``, ``tst_security.sh`` and ``tst_net.sh``
(all in ``testcases/lib`` directory).

Changes in the shell API should not introduce uncommon dependencies
(use basic commands installed everywhere by default).

Shell libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Aside from shell API libraries in ``testcases/lib``, it's worth putting
common code for a group of tests into a shell library. The filename
should end with ``_lib.sh`` and the library should load ``tst_test.sh`` or
``tst_net.sh``.

Shell libraries should have conditional expansion for ``TST_SETUP`` or
``TST_CLEANUP``, to avoid surprises when test specific setup/cleanup function is
redefined by shell library.

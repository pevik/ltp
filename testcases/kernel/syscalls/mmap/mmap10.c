/*\
 * [Description]
 *
 * This test examines the functionality of mapping and unmapping /dev/zero,
 * which is a common method for allocating anonymous memory in Solaris.
 *
 * The primary objective is to determine whether it is possible to successfully
 * map and unmap /dev/zero, as well as to read from and write to the mapped
 * memory. The design of this test is inspired by two previous bugs,
 * incorporating variations based on their reproducers. Additionally, the test
 * accepts an option to mmap/munmap anonymous pages.
 *
 * One of the bugs aims to trigger a panic related to the transparent hugepage
 * feature. The split_huge_page function is particularly strict in verifying
 * that the reverse mapping (rmap) walk is accurate. This strictness is crucial
 * because if the page_mapcount is not stable or correct, the subsequent
 * __split_huge_page_refcount operation could lead to inconsistent page_count()
 * values for the subpages. A bug related to fork caused the rmap walk to find
 * the parent huge-pmd twice instead of once, due to the anon_vma_chain objects
 * of the child VMA still pointing to the parent's vma->vm_mm. This
 * inconsistency triggers a failure in the split_huge_page mapcount versus
 * page_mapcount check, resulting in a BUG_ON.
 *
 * The second bug involves the mmap() operation on /dev/zero, which invokes
 * map_zero(). On RHEL5, this function maps the ZERO_PAGE into every page table
 * entry (PTE) within the specified virtual address range. When an application
 * maps a region from 5M to 16M and operates in a multi-threaded environment,
 * the subsequent munmap() of /dev/zero leads to TLB shootdowns across all CPUs.
 * When this occurs thousands or millions of times, it severely degrades
 * application performance. The optimization of mapping the ZERO_PAGE in every
 * PTE within that virtual address range was intended to enhance page fault
 * handling times on RHEL5 but has since been modified or removed in upstream
 * versions.
